            </ul>
            <p>
                <i>Hades</i>, as the ruler of the Underworld, didn&rsquo;t reside on <i>Mount Olympus</i> with the rest of the Olympians, and is not considered one of the twelve.

                <h1>Titanomachy - The Ten Year War</h1>
                <p>
                    When Kronos awoke he was outraged that his wife had betrayed him but even more so that his children, who were prophesied to overthrow him, were now free. The Titans and the Gods assembled to fight each other but it was obvious from the beginning that the gods were outnumbered by a long way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the war, Gaia&rsquo;s help would prove invaluable to the Gods. She had previously helped Kronos to free the Hecatonchires from Tartarus only for him to lock them away again. Zeus freed them along with the Cyclopes who were master craftsmen. In return for their freedom, the Hecatonchires pledged their allegiance to the Gods in the war. The Cyclopes created thunderbolts for Zeus, the weapons that would help turn the tide in the fight against the Titans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After ten years of brutal fighting, the gods prevailed and the enemy Titans including Kronos were locked away in Tartarus for the rest of eternity. Zeus and the other gods took up residence on <i>Mount Olympus</i> and together they ruled the world unlike <i>Kronos&rsquo;</i> authoritarian rule.

                <h1>Prometheus</h1>
                <p>
                    The world in which the Olympians ruled was perfect, albeit boring so Zeus decided to create a new race. With the help from <i>Prometheus</i>, one of the few loyal Titans, Zeus created humans to inhabit his perfect world as playthings for the gods amusement. <i>Prometheus</i> fashioned the humans out of clay held together with saliva from Zeus. After a day baking in the scorching heat of the sun, they were finally ready. <i>Athena</i>, <i>Zeus&rsquo;</i> favourite daughter was chosen to breathe life into these new beings and in doing so she imbued them with her wisdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Prometheus</i> loved his creations but they were missing the real spark of life. One evening while the Olympians were occupied he climbed <i>Mount Olympus</i> and broke into <i>Hephaestus&rsquo;</i> forge. He used a <b>fennel stalk</b> to retrieve some of the fire from the forge and fled. <i>Prometheus</i> then gave this fire to the humans and taught them how to use it, against the wishes of <i>Zeus</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When <i>Zeus</i> found out about what <i>Prometheus</i> did, his fury at the betrayal by his friend was unimaginable. The punishment that <i>Zeus</i> decided upon was that <i>Prometheus</i> would be chained to a rock for eternity. Every day he would be visited by an eagle who would eat his liver out, an excruciatingly painful ordeal. Being a Titan, his liver would regrow and then the next day the eagle would return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the humans were not at fault, <i>Zeus&rsquo;</i> fury was so great that he designed a &lsquo;gift&rsquo; to punish them too. Hermes delivered a <b>mysterious jar</b> to one of the humans called <i>Pandora</i>. She swore to never open it but eventually curiosity overcame her and <i>Pandora</i> opened the seal on the jar. From this jar poured misery, old age, starvation, pain, murder and a whole manner of evil to punish the humans.

            <h1>Some additional info</h1>
            <p>
                The Roman name for <i>Hades</i>, the god of Wealth and Opulence, is <i>Pluto</i>. This is where the word <b>plutonium</b> comes from and also <b>plutocracy</b> meaning a government run by the wealthy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Greek Mythology hospitality, <i>Xenia</i>, is of the utmost importance and to go against <i>Xenia</i> was one of the most serious crimes in the eyes of the gods. This is where words like <b>xenophobia</b> are derived from.
