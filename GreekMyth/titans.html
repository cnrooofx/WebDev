                <h1>Gaia&rsquo;s Revenge</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>Gaia</i> loved the <i>Cyclopes</i> and the <i lang="el">Hecatoncheires</i> but when <i>Ouranos</i> saw them with their hundred hands and fifty heads he was disgusted at how monstrous they were. They were the most powerful beings yet and <i>Ouranos</i> feared that they would grow up and threaten his supreme rule thus he cast them to the depths of Tartarus. Gaia was <em>furious</em> and urged all of her children, in turn, to help her get revenge. All refused to help her, all except for <i>Kronos</i>, the youngest and most fearless of the Titans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Kronos</i> laid in wait with a giant sickle created for him by <i>Gaia</i>. Later that night when <i>Ouranos</i> came to copulate with <i>Gaia</i>, he castrated his father and cast his genitals into the ocean. When they came into contact with the ocean the water began to froth and foam and the <b>Goddess of Beauty</b>, <i>Aphrodite</i>, emerged. With <i>Ouranos</i> now powerless, <i>Kronos</i> and his sister <i>Rhea</i> took over from their father king and queen of the world. The Titans were now the most powerful beings in the cosmos. <i>Kronos</i> imprisoned the <i lang="el">Hecatoncheires</i> back in Tartarus which was the opposite of what <i>Gaia</i> had asked him to do. This would later prove to be a grave mistake on his part.

                <h1>The Reign of the Titans</h1>
                <p>
                    With his father out of the picture, <i>Kronos</i> ruled supreme over the world in what was <b>the Golden Age</b>. <i>Gaia</i> and <i>Ouranos</i> prophesied that one day, <i>Kronos</i> would be overthrown by one of his sons as he did to his father. Despite this, he and his sister <i>Rhea</i> had six children together. As a precaution to prevent the prophecy from coming true, <i>Kronos</i> ate his first children <i>Hestia</i>, <i>Demeter</i>, <i>Demeter</i>, <i>Hades</i> and <i>Hades</i>. This horrified <i>Rhea</i> and she pleaded to <i>Gaia for help</i> and together they devised a plan to trick <i>Kronos</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When their last child <i>Zeus</i> was born, <i>Rhea</i> gave <i>Kronos</i> a <b>rock wrapped up in a blanket</b>. Thinking that it was one of his children, <i>Kronos</i> ate the rock and she was able to hide her son <i>Zeus</i> away on <i>Mount Ida</i> in Crete. There he was placed under the care of the goat <i lang="el">Amalthea</i>. <i>Zeus</i> grew up and received training from <i>Gaia&rsquo;s</i> friend <i>Metis</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his seventeenth birthday, <i>Gaia</i> came to visit her son <i>Zeus</i>, it was time to get her revenge. Armed with only a potion to induce vomiting, they made their way from Crete to <i>Mount Othrys</i>. <i>Zeus</i> presented a goblet of wine to his father under the guise of a cupbearer and <i>Kronos</i> gulped it down greedily, not knowing of the potion. He soon began to feel sick and one by one he vomited all of his children up. Exhausted, <i>Kronos</i> collapsed and the newly freed children all escaped safely.
