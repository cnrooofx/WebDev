For my account creation system I have used Python's built-in mail packages to send
out passwords via email. I used the EFF wordlist to generate a password consisting
of three random words.
Once logged in the user then has the option to change the default password.

In the unlikely event that you do forget your password in the time that you're grading my work,
I have implemented a password reset facility that uses email to send out a
temporary code to verify before allowing the password to be reset
