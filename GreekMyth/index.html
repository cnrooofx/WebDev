            <p>
                I have had an interest in Greek Mythology for many years and the cultural influences still present in Western society never cease to amaze me. Although the Roman Empire conquered Ancient Greece after <i>the Battle of Corinth</i> in 146 BCE, the stories from Greek Mythology were adapted and combined into their mythology and are still visible in many places today such as the names of the planets.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is estimated that Greek Mythology as we know it has <i>Minoan</i> and <i>Mycenean</i> origins, the Bronze Age civilizations of modern-day Greece, dating back as far as the 18th century BCE. The first written accounts are the <cite>Odyssey</cite> and the <cite>Iliad</cite>, written by the Greek poet <i>Homer</i> and the <cite>Theogony</cite> written by <i>Hesiod</i> around the same period.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will mainly focus on <cite>Theogony</cite> as it depicts the origins of the gods.

                    Today the origin of the universe is explained by the Big Bang, in Greek Mythology everything in the Cosmos began out of <i>Chaos</i>. As with many aspects of myth, it is uncertain what exactly <i>Chaos</i> is but it is from this that the <i>Primordial Deities</i> emerged. It is from these beings that <b>all Greek gods and heroes</b> originate from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first beings that came to exist were <i lang="el">Gaia</i>, the Earth, <i>Tartarus</i>, the depths beneath the earth, and <i>Eros</i>, love and desire. Gaia then gave birth to <i lang="el">Ouranos</i>, the Sky and Heaven, and <i>Pontus</i>, the Sea. These <i>Primordial Deities</i> were not just deities but embodied the very concepts which they ruled over. The building blocks that made up the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i lang="el">Gaia</i> and <i lang="el">Ouranos</i>, although mother and son, were also husband and wife. Together they had many children, the three <i>Cyclops</i>, the three <i lang="el">Hecatoncheires</i> (Hundred-Handed Ones) and the twelve <i>Titans</i>.

            <p>
                I have barely scratched the surface of Greek Mythology on this website. If you would like to learn more, I would highly recommend the books <cite>Mythos</cite> and <cite>Heroes</cite> by Stephen Fry.
