            <h1>Heroes</h1>
            <p>
                These stories are set <em>much</em> later than those of the gods and are like a bridge between the mythological realms of the gods and the real world. Probably the most famous of these are from <i>Homer&rsquo;s</i> epic poems, the <b>Odyssey</b> and the <b>Iliad</b>.
            </p>

                <h1>Heracles</h1>
                <p>
                    Heracles, more commonly known by his roman name Hercules, was the son of <i>Zeus</i> and the human <i>Alcmene</i>. Being an iligitimate son of Zeus, <i>Hera</i> always had an  hatred of <i>Heracles</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His divine parentage made <i>Heracles</i> a <b>demigod</b> and he inherited imense strength from his father. Out of jealousy, <i>Hera</i> sent two venomous snakes to kill him and his twin brother <i>Iphicles</i> in their crib. Unfortunately for <i>Hera</i>, her plan didn&rsquo;t work and <i>Heracles</i> began to play with the snakes and strangled them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not satisfied, <i>Hera</i> cast a curse on <i>Heracles</i> that drove him mad and caused him to kill his wife and children. Unsure of what to do he visited the <i>Oracle of Delphi</i> for advice. <i>Hera</i> had interfered with the Oracle and she directed <i>Heracles</i> to serve <i>King Eurystheus</i>, his archenemy, for ten long years and to undertake any task that was asked of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over ten years, <i>King Eurystheus</i> ordered Heracles to perform all manner of seemingly impossible tasks, all of which he suceeded in. He killed a lion with his bare hands; he had to retrieve <b>the girdle of Hippolyta</b>, <i>Queen of the Amazons</i>; he stole a <b>golden apple of the <i>Hesperides</i></b> and finally he descended into the underworld and brought <i>Cerberus</i>, the three-headed dog who guarded the gates, back to the King.

                    Prometheus, who was still chained up to his rock, was freed by <i>Heracles</i> who shot down the eagle

                <h1>Jason & The Argonauts - The Odyssey</h1>
                <p>
                    Jason was the true heir to the throne of <i>Thessaly</i> but <i>Pelias</i>, who had usurped the throne from Jason&rsquo;s father, demanded that he retrieve the Golden Fleece in order to become King.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He assembled a crew of legendary heroes to sail aboard the <i>Argo</i>. They became known as the <i>Argonauts</i> after the ship. They made their way to Colchis to claim the fleece but <i>King Aeetes</i>, who had heard of the great expedition, was not giving it up easily. The King promised to give it to Jason if he alone could complete three  tasks. The tasks were as impossible as those given to <i>Heracles</i> and Jason feared the worst.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fleece was hidden in an ancient tree in the middle of the palace gardens guarded by a dragon. Jason didn&rsquo;t know what to do but <i>King Aeetes&rsquo;</i> daughter <i>Medea</i> gave him a potion to put the dragon to sleep. He was able to grab the fleece, Medea distracted her father and together Jason and Medea escaped.
